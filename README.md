# Prodigy Infotech Internship Task 3 - Bank Marketing Dataset Classifier

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a classifier model to predict whether a customer has subscribed for a term deposit or not using the Bank Marketing Dataset. The task was a part of the Prodigy Infotech data science internship.

## Contents
- `data/`: Directory containing the Bank Marketing Dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Directory containing Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, and model building.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Exploration**: Explored the Bank Marketing Dataset to understand its structure and features.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Performed necessary cleaning and preprocessing steps to handle missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies in the data.
3. **Data Visualization**: Visualized various aspects of the dataset to gain insights and understand the distribution of different features.
4. **Label Encoding**: Encoded categorical variables to numerical format using label encoding.
5. **Selecting Independent and Dependent Features**: Identified independent features (predictors) and dependent feature (target) for model building.
6. **Splitting Train and Test Dataset**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
7. **Building Decision Tree Classifier Model**: Implemented a decision tree classifier model using scikit-learn.
8. **Generating Predictions and Evaluating Accuracy Score**: Made predictions using the trained model and evaluated its accuracy score.

## Results
- Achieved an accuracy score of 90% on the test dataset using the decision tree classifier model.

## Dataset
The Bank Marketing Dataset contains 20 features and 1 target variable (deposit) indicating whether a customer has subscribed for a term deposit or not.

## Note
This dataset is considered one of the best for making predictions, and the achieved accuracy score of 90% reflects the effectiveness of the implemented model.
